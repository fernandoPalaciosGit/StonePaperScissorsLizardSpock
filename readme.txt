I am gonna build the Big Bang Theory game Stone, Paper Scissors Lizard Spoke.

These are the rules:

1. Scissors vs paper = Scissors
2. Paper vs Stone = Paper
3. Stone vs Lizard = Stone
4. Lizard vs Spoke = Lizard
5. Spoke vs Scissors = Spoke
6. Scissors vs Lizard = Scissors
7. Lizard vs Paper = Lizard
8. Paper vs spock = Paper
9. Spoke vs stone = Spoke
10. Stone vs scissors = Stone

Scissors: 2
Paper: 2
Stone: 1
Lizard: 2
Spoke: 2


I am going to start the game building the User interface. My idea is to make 5 buttons, and something as an scorer at the top of the page.
